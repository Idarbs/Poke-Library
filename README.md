# API & JSON Project
I created a program using the Pokémon API to search Nested JSONs and output information regarding each Pokémon. <br/>

# Comments
Because this API doesn't use specific API keys, there is no need to hide anything. <br/>
The user input directly sends the request towards that Pokémon's page. If there is something, the program will catch it; if not, then the program handles it. <br/>
The data that is returned is information like the Pokémon's height, type, abilities, and the games they have appeared in. <br/>

# Personal Comments
Before this project, my knowledge of Python programming was limited to the basics. <br/>
Doing this project has allowed me to see the vast possibilities and scripts that can be written using Python. <br/>
Although the project itself is small, I learned a great deal from it (Like handling Nested JSON Data, Making Requests). <br/>
